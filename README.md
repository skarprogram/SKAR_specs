This is a Powershell script to collect computer hardware and software information. Generates HTML file. No interface. Take that HTML file and send it to your Tech guy :) or as an admin collect basic info about company computers for inventory purposes.

This came about as many computer specs software need licensing to use in company setting. HWInfo, AIDA32...
Speccy was nice but development stopped or something like that.

The purpose of this is to generate a file with computer info for fast report generation. This is about basic hardware and software info.

Generate reports to quickly have computer inventory in your company to reference when upgrades or reports are needed.


Run it with Powershell or make it an exe file.

Tested mostly on Windows 10 and 11 computers.
