This is a Powershell script to collect computer hardware and software information. Generates HTML file. No interface. Take that HTML file and send it to your Tech guy :) or as an admin collect basic info about company computers for inventory purposes.

This came about as many computer specs software need licensing to use in company setting. HWInfo, AIDA32...
Speccy was nice but development stopped or something like that.

This is about basic hardware and software info.

Generate report quickly. Collect computer's inventory in your company to reference when upgrades or reports are needed.

Run it with Powershell or make it an exe file.

Tested mostly on Windows 10 and 11 computers.

ISSUES:
If anybody know how to get multiple screen support with Powershell please contribute. ChatGPT did not help. All suggestions produced 0 monitors. Would like to get monitors models and serial numbers.
Report anything else. I am not programmer but I am interested.

Report looks like:
