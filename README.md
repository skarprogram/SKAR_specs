This is a Powershell script to collect computer hardware and software information.

This came about as many computer specs software need licensing to use in company setting. HWInfo, AIDA32...
Speccy was nice but development stopped or something like that.

The purpose of this is to generate a file with computer info for fast report generation. This is about basic hardware and software info.
